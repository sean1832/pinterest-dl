> [!NOTE]
> **Version 1.0 is here!** This release brings improved stability, better error handling, and enhanced testing (56 comprehensive tests). All existing code continues to work without any changes - we've maintained full backward compatibility.

This library facilitates the scraping and downloading of medias (including images and video stream) from [Pinterest](https://pinterest.com). Using reverse engineered Pinterest API and browser automation ([Playwright](https://playwright.dev) by default, with [Selenium](https://selenium.dev) as fallback), it enables users to extract images from a specified Pinterest URL and save them to a chosen directory.

It includes a [CLI](#-cli-usage) for direct usage and a [Python API](#️-python-api) for programmatic access. The tool supports scraping medias from public and private boards and pins using browser cookies. It also allows users to save scraped URLs to a JSON file for future access.

> [!TIP]
> If you are looking for a GUI version of this tool, check out [pinterest-dl-gui](https://github.com/sean1832/pinterest-dl-gui).
> It provides a user-friendly interface for scraping and downloading media from Pinterest using the same underlying library. It could also serve as a reference for integrating the library into your own GUI application.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ Scrape media directly from a Pinterest URL.
- ✅ Asynchronously download media from a list of URLs. ([#1](https://github.com/sean1832/pinterest-dl/pull/1))
- ✅ Save scraped URLs to a JSON file for future access.
- ✅ Incognito mode to keep your scraping discrete.
- ✅ Access detailed output for effective debugging.
- ✅ Support for the Firefox browser.
- ✅ Insert `alt` text for media as metadata `comment` in the downloaded media for searchability.
- ✅ Optionally save `alt` text as a separate text file for each media. ([#32](https://github.com/sean1832/pinterest-dl/pull/32))
- ✅ Scrape private boards and pins with browser cookies. ([#20](https://github.com/sean1832/pinterest-dl/pull/20))
- ✅ Scrape media using reversed engineered Pinterest API. (This will be default behaviour. You can use webdriver by specifying `--client chrome` or `--client firefox`) ([#21](https://github.com/sean1832/pinterest-dl/pull/21))
- ✅ Search for media on Pinterest using a query. ([#23](https://github.com/sean1832/pinterest-dl/pull/23))
- ✅ Support multiple urls and queries in a single command.
- ✅ Support for batch processing of URLs and queries from files.
- ✅ Download video streams if available.
- ✅ **Playwright support** - faster and more reliable browser automation (default), with Selenium as fallback (`--backend selenium`).

## 🚩 Known Issues
- 🔲 Not able to scrape nested boards yet.

## 📋 Requirements
- Python 3.10 or newer
- (Optional) Playwright browsers: `playwright install chromium` or `playwright install firefox`
- (Optional) For Selenium backend: Chrome or Firefox browser with matching WebDriver
- (Optional) [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for video remuxing to MP4 (with `--video` option). If remux fails, automatically falls back to re-encoding. Use `--skip-remux` to download raw .ts files without ffmpeg.
